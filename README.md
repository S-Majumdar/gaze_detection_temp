## TEMP
This is temp. repo. only for testing. 
## JAI
All the combined files are in the Scripts dir. 
Run jsut the `combined.py` and see if the google part works. I couldnt check it coz of the auth key.
If it works properly, I'll push the actual version to the main repo.
Have a different layout for the directories in my local repo that i will push later.
